# History Simulation Simulator
Submission for HackIllinois 2020. 

This project is meant to be a simple game creator for educators. Specifically, it is targeted at history teachers who want to continue to run their simulations in
the absence of a classroom. A favorite part of my high school history classes has always been doing simulations where each student is given a character to roleplay and debate as.

[Download for Windows & Mac Here](https://emicb.itch.io/history-simulation-simulator) (I recommend getting the [itch.io desktop app](https://itch.io/app) since it acts as a launcher)
