  title: "Female Graduate Student, Women\u2019s Liberation Cadre Leader"
  biography: "Your parents were both Polish-American Jews who grew up in Chicago
    and met there, but then moved to the suburbs when you were in elementary school
    in the late 1940s.  Your parents were socialists (and still are to some extent,
    though they told you that they have tried to keep their beliefs quiet ever since
    the Red Scare).  They made you go to Hebrew school, but you are fairly secular
    today, although you do credit your belief in the importance of social justice
    to your Jewish cultural heritage.  You have always excelled in school, graduated
    with honors from University of Chicago, and are currently writing your dissertation
    in Sociology.\r\nYou are strongly opposed to the Vietnam War.  It is an example
    of the United States\u2019 effort to dominate other countries and oppress their
    people, which is in turn a manifestation of male oppression.  Like the Redstockings
    said in their manifesto, \u201CAll other forms of exploitation and oppression
    (racism, capitalism, imperialism, etc.) are extensions of male supremacy: men
    dominate women, a few men dominate the rest.\u201D  As such, the war must be
    stopped.\r\nBut that can\u2019t be the only item on the radical agenda.  Women
    are an oppressed class in every aspect of their lives: at home, at school, in
    politics, and at work (if they are allowed to work!)  Even among the radical
    leftists, misogyny runs rampant.  You used to be a member of organizations like
    the Radical Union, but the men who ran those organizations only paid lip service
    to women\u2019s issues. That\u2019s why you started the Women\u2019s Liberation
    Cadre, so women could mobilize to free themselves from their oppressors.  Your
    goal to raise women\u2019s consciousness so they see how they are oppressed and
    fight for their liberation.  If you mobilize as a group, you can pressure the
    powers-that-be to change policies, and the other leftists will be forced to recognize
    the agenda of women\u2019s liberation.  For example, you were able to get the
    Radical Union to join you in threatening to picket the recent Date Auction at
    Newman Center (see readings)\u2014where women (described as cheerleaders and
    pompom girls!) were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.  You forced the
    organizers to shut down the event, though you heard rumors that other people
    are trying to hold the event in a new location.\r\nAs leader of the WLC, you
    need to make sure to do what it takes to make sure that women\u2019s issues are
    included in any broader radical program.  Do not let your interests be overlooked!\r\n"
