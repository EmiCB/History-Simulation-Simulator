  title: "Junior Female, Women\u2019s Liberation Cadre"
  biography: "You were born in a small town about an hour from Champaign-Urbana,
    and never felt like you quite fit in.  While everyone else was going to the pep
    rally for the football game, you were off somewhere reading a book.  You started
    really thinking about politics during high school, and you came to realize that
    you believed different things than most of the conservative people around you,
    including your parents.  You also came to really resent the way women were treated
    in your community; it seemed like none of the men did any work around the house,
    while the women were expected to do everything with cooking and childcare.  You
    love your dad, but you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ve ever seen him clean a dish.\r\nWhen
    you came to campus at the University of Illinois, you became strongly opposed
    to the Vietnam War.  It is an example of the United States\u2019 effort to dominate
    other countries and oppress their people, which is in turn a manifestation of
    male oppression.  Like the Redstockings said in their manifesto, \u201CAll other
    forms of exploitation and oppression (racism, capitalism, imperialism, etc.)
    are extensions of male supremacy: men dominate women, a few men dominate the
    rest.\u201D  As such, the war must be stopped.\r\nYou\u2019ve been involved in
    antiwar activism throughout your time at University of Illinois\u2014you were
    even arrested during the GE protests.  But you are also a member of the Women\u2019s
    Liberation Cadre because you need to fight alongside other women to win freedom
    for yourselves.  For example, you were able to get the Radical Union to join
    you in threatening to picket the recent Date Auction at Newman Center (see readings)\u2014where
    women (described as cheerleaders and pompom girls!) were being auctioned off
    to the highest bidder.  You forced the organizers to shut down the event, though
    you heard rumors that other people are trying to hold the event in a new location.
    In your reading, you\u2019ll find other issues that your character is passionate
    about.\r\nAs a member of the WLC, you need to make sure to do what it takes to
    make sure that women\u2019s issues are included in any broader radical program. 
    Do not let your interests be overlooked!\r"
