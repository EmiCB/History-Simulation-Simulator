  title: Wealthy Landowner, Patriot
  biography: "You are a filthy rich landowner with a number of slaves, as well as
    a lot of tenant farmers who work your land and pay rent (this is how you make
    most of your money).  You also make money in trade; significantly, any goods
    that your tenant farmers buy are from the shops that you own.  You also control
    money lending.   You are a man of great importance, and you should make sure
    that everyone calls you Mister Livingston.  \r\nThere are two major political
    factions in New York Politics.  One is controlled by James Delancey, and you
    control the other.  That means that many other politicians listen to what you
    say. When your faction controls the New York Assembly, you also control important
    government jobs and give them out to your supporters.  \r\nThe Delancey faction
    has moved towards the Loyalist side in recent years. For this reason (more than
    your principled opposition to British policies) you have sided with the Patriots.
    More than anything, you want political power, but you are very happy to speak
    eloquently about your deep convictions regarding liberty and the evils of taxation
    without representation.  \r\nAs a Patriot, you have decided to ally with the
    Sons of Liberty.  However, you feel a little uneasy about this.  They participate
    in a lot of mob action, and that worries you, since you are a wealthy property
    owner and a moderate (You don\u2019t like disorder among the rabble).  That said,
    you realize that it is essential to have the support of the Sons of Liberty to
    retain power.  After all, you used to have their support in 1765 when the Stamp
    Act was repealed, but then they defected to the Delancey faction in the late
    1760s, and then you lost control of the assembly!  Now that the Delancey\u2019s
    have moved towards the loyalists, the Sons of Liberty are back supporting you,
    and you want to keep their support. \r\nThat said, you are far too respectable
    to participate in mobs or orchestrate in mob activity.  Make sure that Sears
    and McDougall (your patriot colleagues and leaders of the Sons of Liberty) are
    the ones who lead the mobs.\r\nFinally, know that you are very rich. Therefore,
    you can use your wealth to bribe one of the moderates ONCE in the game.  The
    moderates are all farmers who owe money to a lender (not you), and you can offer
    to pay off their debts in exchange for their political support in the next vote. 
    You can make this arrangement outside of class.  I\u2019ll need a signed agreement
    so that I know the deal took place.  "
