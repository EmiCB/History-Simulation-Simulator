  title: Merchant and Leader of the Sons of Liberty, Patriot
  biography: "You are a fire-breathing radical, a true believer in the patriot cause
    who is willing to do anything to oppose the British.  You grew up in poverty
    after arriving in New York City in 1738, but you made a huge fortune during the
    French and Indian War\u2014you were a privateer, hijacking French ships and taking
    all their loot (in wartime, that makes you a patriot not a pirate).  With that
    money, you became a wealthy merchant. \r\nHowever, you were never fully accepted
    by the New York social and political elite. You didn\u2019t have the right pedigree
    and you have a bit of resentment for the Livingstons and Delanceys of the world. 
    However, you found your calling with the Sons of Liberty, at the helm of the
    mob.  In 1770, when the British repealed most (but not all!) of the taxes of
    the Townshend Acts, you were furious when Delancey and some of the leading merchants
    gave up the boycott.  You wrote a scathing letter (under the pseudonym of \u201CBrutus\u201D)
    in which you called those merchants \u201Cmiscreants\u201D and \u201Caccursed
    Villains\u201D who were seeking their own wealth wile contributing to the \u201Ccountry\u2019s
    ruin.\u201D  You actually served time in jail for a different letter you wrote
    (in your own name) calling out the political leadership of New York for not standing
    up to the British, making you a \u201Cmartyr for liberty\u201D in the eyes of
    many patriots. \r\nAlong with your buddy, Isaac Sears (also a character in the
    simulation), you are now a leader of the Sons of Liberty. You view yourself as
    a true friend of the people: ordinary laborers and seamen who often don\u2019t
    meet the property requirements to vote or serve in public office.   You want
    to help these common people take back control of the government, and you see
    no problem in using mob violence to achieve that goal.  You are siding with the
    Livingston faction, since Livingston is supporting the patriot cause. He\u2019ll
    want to keep his hands clean and not get involved with the mob, but you can help
    him by mobilizing the common people in the patriot cause.  \r\nAs such, your
    character has two major tasks.  1) When you speak in the provincial assembly,
    you should provide passionate defenses of liberty in the face of British oppression.
    You are a true believer, and feel free to go really over the top as someone speaking
    for the \u201Cpeople\u201D in opposition to the corrupt elite.  2) Lead the mob. 
    You should try to enlist your patriot buddies (particularly those in the \u201Ccrowd\u201D)
    to intimidate moderates and loyalists into voting with you.   \r"
