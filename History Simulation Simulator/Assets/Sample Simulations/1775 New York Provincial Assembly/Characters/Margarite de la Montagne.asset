  title: Tavern Owner and Widow, Crowd
  biography: "You are the owner of a tavern, which is located directly across from
    the Common on Broadway, between Warren and Murray Streets. Your name reflects
    your French ancestry, as you and your husband\u2019s family date back to the
    Huguenot wave of French Protestants who came to New York in the 1600s. \n\nMost
    of your women friends call you Peg, but most men call you \u201CWidow Montagne,\u201D
    a term of respect for your ability to run your tavern profitably in a town with
    over 300 competitors. You are known as tough but fair dealer with your suppliers,
    and a woman who serves all customers.\r\n\r\nYour marriage lasted but 12 years,
    and produced one son who is now 17. Like many brides in this generation, you
    went to the altar pregnant. All subsequent pregnancies ended in miscarriages
    or stillbirths.  Your husband died before he could inherit land from his father
    located in Harlem, but your husband did leave you all of his real and personal
    property in his will. Primarily, that property was the tavern (which has two
    stories, the second floor has rooms which you rent out) and the town lot on which
    it is located. You are thus a property owner, a taxpayer (you would easily qualify
    for the vote if you were\r\nmale), and for the last 5 years you have made it
    a profitable business, surviving the political winds and protecting your son
    from harm. You have done well enough to purchase a slave, and have thus been
    able to release your son from helping in the tavern, so that he might learn the
    trade of printing. He is now an apprentice, still living at home, but he is fired
    with patriotic zeal. He has been running with the mobs, protecting the Liberty
    Pole at night.\r\n\r\nYou too lean to the patriot\u2019s side, and you are happy
    your son has such fierce convictions. You worry about losing him in a war\u2014he\u2019s
    your only child. What can be worth the life of a child? You believe in the cause
    of the patriots, in their arguments. You have seen the British soldiers in your
    place with prostitutes, many of them just young girls of families you know that
    have fallen on hard times. You have been willing to participate in the boycotts
    to halt British control over New York and the colonies. You are also happy to
    join a mob to help the Patriot cause.  But you do sometimes wonder: is not my
    property taxed without my consent by the colony same as it would be by the British?\r"
